# Instagram Post Integration üì∏

DatePlan now supports using Instagram posts as inspiration for activities! Here's how it works:

## ‚ú® Features

### Supported Instagram URL Types
- **Regular Posts**: `https://www.instagram.com/p/POST_ID/`
- **Reels**: `https://www.instagram.com/reel/REEL_ID/`
- **IGTV**: `https://www.instagram.com/tv/VIDEO_ID/`
- **Stories**: `https://www.instagram.com/stories/username/STORY_ID/`
- **Mobile URLs**: `m.instagram.com` (automatically converted)
- **Short URLs**: `instagr.am` (automatically converted)

### How Instagram Integration Works
Unlike other platforms that auto-extract details, Instagram integration provides a **manual-input approach** that:

- **Creates a basic structure** with the post type and username
- **Lets you describe** what you want to do based on the post
- **Gives you full control** over the activity details
- **Respects privacy** by not scraping post content
- **Works with any post** (public or private, doesn't matter!)

### What Gets Pre-filled
- **Title**: Basic title like "Instagram Reel by @username"
- **Description**: Placeholder text asking you to describe the activity
- **Category**: Default to Entertainment (you can change this)
- **Duration**: Default 2 hours (easily adjustable)
- **Location**: Placeholder for you to fill in
- **Cost**: Set to $0 (you specify the actual cost)

## üéØ How to Use

1. **Find an Instagram Post**: Browse Instagram for activity inspiration
2. **Copy the URL**: Use the share button to copy the post link
3. **Open DatePlan**: Go to "Add Activity"
4. **Paste & Auto-fill**: Paste the Instagram URL and click "Auto-fill"
5. **Describe Your Activity**: Fill in what YOU want to do based on the post
6. **Set Details**: Add location, cost, category, etc.
7. **Save & Plan**: Save your activity and drag it to your calendar!

## üí° Why Manual Input?

### Privacy & Reliability
- **No account required**: Works without Instagram API access

### Better Planning

- **Local context**: Add your specific location details
- **Creative freedom**: Adapt the idea to your preferences
